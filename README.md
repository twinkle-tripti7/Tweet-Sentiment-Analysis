# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data from Twitter messages. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and classification with a Random Forest classifier.

# Features
Text Preprocessing: The project includes text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling special characters and URLs.

Feature Extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features, capturing the importance of words in each document relative to the corpus.

Machine Learning Model: Implements a Random Forest classifier to predict sentiment based on the TF-IDF features extracted from text data.

Pipeline Integration: Uses the sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline to streamline the workflow of text processing and model training.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance using accuracy score metrics on a separate test dataset.

# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for scripting and data manipulation.

# Libraries:

scikit-learn for machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation.
spacy for stopword removal.
pickle for serializing trained models.
Development Tools:

# IDE: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm
Version Control: Git, GitHub
Usage
